# water_dynamics_on_paper-oil_insulation
This repository contains a model to simulate the water content dynamics in cellulose-oil insulation over time. The model takes into account the temperature to which the insulation is subjected at each time step. Only mineral oil is considered.


Key features:

* Simulate the water content dynamics in cellulose-oil insulation over time
* Consider the temperature to which the insulation is subjected at each time step
* Only mineral oil is considered
* Select different types of cellulose (kraft paper or pressboard)
* Select different conditions of cellulose (new or aged)
* Include different qualities of dielectric oil modeled with oil acidity
* Include different types of oil modeled with aromatic content
* Use oil-cellulose water content relative saturation equilibrium curves
