dynamica of water (H2O) in Paper-Oil insulation

This repository contains a model to simulate the water content dynamics in cellulose-oil insulation over time. The model takes into account the temperature to which the insulation is subjected at each time step. Only mineral oil is considered.

Overview
---------
Key features:

* Simulate the water content dynamics in cellulose-oil insulation over time
* Consider the temperature to which the insulation is subjected at each time step
* Only mineral oil is considered
* Use different types of cellulose (kraft paper or pressboard)
* Use different conditions of cellulose (new or aged)
* Include different qualities of dielectric oil modeled with oil acidity [mg KOH/g]
* Include different types of oil modeled with aromatic content [%]
* Use oil-cellulose water content relative saturation equilibrium curves
